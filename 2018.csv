The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONTD) Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this...

BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adams hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if its done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because youll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barrys smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didnt know that. ADAM Whats the difference? TRUDY And youll be happy to know that bees as a species havent had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So youll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) Well sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes into a snapshot. Barry looks concerned. The tram continues through 2 doors. FORM DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - WALKING THE HIVE INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON: The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY (annoyed) Whats the difference? Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? Thats an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, Im relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? Were bees. Were the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: Bee Goes Berserk: Stings Seven Then Self. ANGLE ON: A BEE filling his cars gas tank from a honey pump. He fills his car some, then takes a swig for himself. NEWSPAPER BEE (to the bee guzzling gas) Hey! Barry and Adam begin to cross the street. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 10. BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I dont know. But you know what Im talking about. They walk off. SEQ. 400 - MEET THE JOCKS SFX: The SOUND of Pollen Jocks. PAN DOWN from the Honex statue.

BARRY They know what its like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them dont come back. ""Bee Movie"" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! Youre monsters. Youre sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I dont know. BARRY Their days not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You cant just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam."

11/30/2018 14:24,4,Fair,"The reason why I am feeling this way is because last night for me sucked. I was sad at the Trinity thing that we went to for band because I wanted to sit with EJ so that way it could be better for us because last year I feel like I made it awkward for us. But that didn't happen and I was really sad, plus I had to go to a basketball thing and I didn't even play so that was good I guess. And today at lunch and when we were at the football field Freddy necked EJ and I was really mad so I was running to get him back but I got tired and I was laying down in the grass so I got grass in my hair. Yay. But Sunday is my birthday and tomorrow I get to spend the day with EJ (my boyfriend) at 6 Flags. And I'm really happy about it because last year he couldn't go along with everyone else I asked to go with :,). So hopefully this weekend will be good."

I didn't get to see most of his football games, and I didn't really get to see most of his basketball games too. If he were to do track I would be able to see him do his events and he would probably be able to see mine as well. I don't know anymore. I want him to do it but he's telling me to do golf. My parents are telling me the same thing. I want to do golf but not the team at the school. I want to do it with a private teacher and not with a group of kids that will make fun of me when I can't hit the ball. I've told him that but he keeps telling me to do the golf team here so he can help me and so during practice I can walk with him to the golf course and back to the school with him. I want to do golf just not with the team here. And I want him to do track but that won't happen because he won't really listen to me when I bring this up. Now I feel like a bad girlfriend to him.

And I was really hoping I could spend time with him on Friday (even if we have to go to my grandparent's ranch to clean up for Monday).

And I'm really tired of people always trying to bother me and him. Even today at lunch. It gets really annoying and it always ruins the whole mood. Then he'll ask me what's wrong and I'll tell him I'm tired and he never believes me. I just want the day to be over already and go home. Or maybe just nap and fall asleep on him. Oh well.
