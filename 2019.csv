10/31/2019 10:11,91,Excellent,Let me tell you a story. ( It is related to Survivor so...) Alright so they did a tribe swap right. Ok well when they had a tribe swapped on the new tribe there was four old Lario and four old Vokia. So it would probably be a tie but Aaron was willing to flip on old Lario. But in the challenge Elaine had to sit out of it because their tribe had more people on it. But then Elaine had to go to the Island of the Idols. But wait on the Island of the Idols she got a block a vote advantage. The thing is though she had to get it at the next challenge they do. It is under a table so she could risk having other people see her getting it. She gets the advantage though. So they lose the challenge and Aaron is thinking of flipping on Elaine so her block a vote would not matter. But Aaron decides to stay with old Lario. At tribal before they vote Elaine pulls out the block a vote and uses it on Jason so Jason could not vote. At this point everyone still thinks Aaron is going to flip of Elaine but when the votes come in Aaron actually does not flip on old Lario and Jason gets voted out. Pretty EPIC.

11/7/2019 11:04,91,Excellent,"Let me tell you a story. So Vokia beats Lairo in an immunity challenge so I am like oh heck they are going to vote off Dean. I do not want Dean to get voted off so I start to cry. JK. But it seems like Dean is getting voted off. But this girl named Kelle really likes Dean (in a friend way). Kelle has an immunity idol that she can only use at the Tribal Council (were they vote off some one.) So she gives Dean the immunity idol. This were it gets EPIC. So at Tribal Council when they vote they show Karishma's vote (Karishma is a person I really do not like on the show.)  Any way Karishma is like "" You tried to get me out three times and you could not do it. Well I am going to get you at first try!"" Well then Dean plays the idol and I am like HA EAT IT KARISHMA. Then Jack gets voted off because Dean played that idol. VERY EPIC."

11/14/2019 11:06,91,Excellent,Bruh let me tell you a story. So it is the merge episode of Survivor. 13 people are left and it is double episode. LIT!! So Aaron wins immunity so he can't get voted off. Only one person in the merge then had an immunity idol. It was Kelle. Kellee had two idols though. So the plan is to unanimously vote of Dan. But then Elaine told Dan about this and Dan was like hold up bro I ain't cool with dat. So he said let's vote off Kellee. Dan and Kellee had not gotten along ever and Kellee knew Dan was going to try to vote off her. Then some more people wanted to vote off Kellee. So then a tribal it is between Kellee and Dan. After the vote Jeff Probst asks if anyone wants to play a hidden immunity idol. Kelle does not play her idol and she gets voted off. The other episode not much happened in it and Jamal got voted off.
